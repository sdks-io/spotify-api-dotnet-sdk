## Structure

`SectionObject`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Start` | `double?` | Optional | The starting point (in seconds) of the section. |
| `Duration` | `double?` | Optional | The duration (in seconds) of the section. |
| `Confidence` | `double?` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the section's "designation".<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `Loudness` | `double?` | Optional | The overall loudness of the section in decibels (dB). Loudness values are useful for comparing relative loudness of sections within tracks. |
| `Tempo` | `double?` | Optional | The overall estimated tempo of the section in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. |
| `TempoConfidence` | `double?` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the tempo. Some tracks contain tempo changes or sounds which don't contain tempo (like pure speech) which would correspond to a low value in this field.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `Key` | `int?` | Optional | The estimated overall key of the section. The values in this field ranging from 0 to 11 mapping to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation (E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on). If no key was detected, the value is -1. |
| `KeyConfidence` | `double?` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the key. Songs with many key changes may correspond to low values in this field.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `Mode` | [`ModeEnum?`](../../doc/models/mode-enum.md) | Optional | Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a section, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. This field will contain a 0 for "minor", a 1 for "major", or a -1 for no result. Note that the major key (e.g. C major) could more likely be confused with the minor key at 3 semitones lower (e.g. A minor) as both keys carry the same pitches. |
| `ModeConfidence` | `double?` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `mode`.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `TimeSignature` | `int?` | Optional | An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4".<br>**Constraints**: `>= 3`, `<= 7` |
| `TimeSignatureConfidence` | `double?` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `time_signature`. Sections with time signature changes may correspond to low values in this field.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
